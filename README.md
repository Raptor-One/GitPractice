# GitWorkshop
The goal of this workshop is to teach participants how to use Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative coding. To gain a better understanding about the Git workflow, participants can fork this project and make changes.

### Introduction:
Version control systems allow multiple developers, and members to work together on the same project in an effective and efficient fashion. The system ensures that everyone has access to the latest code and that any modifications are tracked during the development process.
